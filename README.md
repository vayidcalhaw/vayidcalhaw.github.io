## Writing & Developing Portfolio

> I coded this website. It serves as a way to organize all my projects. They may include:
>  - the in-progress development of the current game I've been developing, called "Nightfall's Gaze."
>  - ways I have developed my experience in other coding languages with smaller projects.
>  - list of places I've been published for my writing.
>  - (possibly) art in the future.
